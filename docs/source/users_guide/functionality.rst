Functionalities of the tool
===========================

The main functionality of the tool is to interactively visualize Campbell
diagrams. Modes can be added or removed to the plot through the data tree.
Highlighting modes is possible by clicking on the line in the matplotlib diagram
or by selecting the field in the data tree. A second main functionality is a
plot of the participation factors.
This can be started by **Tools -> Plot amplitudes of modes**, **Tools -> Plot
amplitudes of highlighted mode**, or through the context menu of the data tree.
The context menu of the data tree can also be used to select specific modes or
filter modes based on specific characteristics.
