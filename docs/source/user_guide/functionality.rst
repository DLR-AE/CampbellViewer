Functionalities
================

The main functionality of the tool is to interactively visualize Campbell
diagrams. Modes can be added or removed to the plot through the data tree.
Highlighting modes is possible by clicking on the line in the ``Matplotlib`` diagram
or by selecting the field in the data tree.

A second functionality is a plot of the participation factors.
This can be started by selecting **Tools** :octicon:`arrow-right` **Plot amplitudes of modes**,
or by selecting **Tools** :octicon:`arrow-right` **Plot amplitudes of highlighted mode**,
or through the context menu of the data tree. The context menu of the data tree can also be
used to select specific modes or filter modes based on specific characteristics.
